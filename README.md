# BlazesBot
A Discord bot with several games played through text messages.

Currently, the only game is dots and boxes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes
It is played by calling the command: "!playgame dotsandboxes (number from 0-9)x(another number) @opponent"

Then, moves can be made by calling: "!move coord1 coord2" where coords are in this format: "1,2" or "4,5".

In the future, I am planning on adding games like Battleship and Stratego.
